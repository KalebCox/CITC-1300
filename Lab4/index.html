                <p>Lions are at the top of the food chain and are quite powerful creatures. They are carnivorous animals that have to hunt and kill to survive.</p>

                <p>The sun is what breathes life into our solar system, it's a ball of energy that is even more dangerous up close than it is from afar. Anything that comes in contact is usually vaporized if it hadn't already when approaching.</p>
